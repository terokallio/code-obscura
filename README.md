# code-obscura
Code obscura (from Latin "code": (vaulted) chamber or room, and "obscura": darkened, plural: codea obscurae), also referred to as pinhole script, is the natural programming phenomenon that occurs when an codeblock of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as a reversed and inverted code (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The surroundings of the projected code have to be relatively dark for the code to be clear, so many historical code obscura experiments were performed in dark rooms.
